        //other (failed) approaches:
        //- inheriting from LordJob_TradeWithColony and overriding the stategraph. Set a bool in the job, which works as a trigger. Still seems like the "correct" and OOP approach, but I suck at C#
        //- adding new LordToil_ExitMapAndEscortCarriers() & telling the lord to jump to it. (lord null, somehow not registered in graph?)
        //- Outright removing the lord. Works, but also removes the traderflag, defending at exit and the group behaviour. Bad.
        //- transpile all the things! (ain't noone got time for that)
